  **Design Movement**: "Aquatic Zen / Minimalist Nature"
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Serenity**: The site should feel calm and peaceful, mimicking the effect of watching a fish tank.
  2.  **Clarity**: High contrast, clean lines, and uncluttered layouts to highlight the vibrant colors of the fish.
  3.  **Flow**: Smooth scrolling and gentle transitions that feel like water movement.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Primary**: Deep Ocean Blue (#004E64) - Represents depth and trust.
  *   **Secondary**: Soft Teal (#25A18E) - Represents fresh water and vitality.
  *   **Accent**: Coral Orange (#FF6B6B) - To highlight call-to-actions and mimic the color of tropical fish.
  *   **Background**: Off-white / Pale Mist (#F5F9FA) - To keep the content readable and airy.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetrical balance. Use large, high-quality imagery on one side balanced by clean, sans-serif typography on the other. Avoid rigid grids; let elements "float" slightly.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Water Ripple Effects**: Subtle CSS animations on hover or background.
  *   **Rounded Organic Shapes**: Images clipped in soft, pebble-like shapes rather than sharp squares.
  *   **Translucent Overlays**: Glassmorphism effects for cards and navigation to simulate looking through water.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Gentle and fluid. Buttons should have a "liquid" fill effect on hover.
  **Animation**: Slow, easing-in animations. Elements should drift into place rather than snap.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: 'Montserrat' (Bold, Clean) - Modern and legible.
  *   **Body**: 'Open Sans' or 'Lato' - Friendly and easy to read.

  **Design Movement**: "Scientific Explorer / Field Guide"
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Authenticity**: Focus on the biological beauty and details of the fish.
  2.  **Structure**: Organized, catalog-style layout that feels like a premium nature magazine.
  3.  **Discovery**: Encourage users to explore different species.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Primary**: Slate Gray (#2C3E50) - Professional and grounding.
  *   **Secondary**: Olive Green (#556B2F) - Natural, riverbed tones.
  *   **Accent**: Golden Yellow (#F1C40F) - Highlights and special offers.
  *   **Background**: Paper texture or warm beige (#FDFBF7).
  **Layout Paradigm**: Card-based grid system (Bootstrap friendly) but elevated with detailed borders and typography.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Line Illustrations**: Subtle line drawings of fish or plants in the background.
  *   **Detailed Spec Cards**: Product cards that look like biological data tags.
  *   **Serif Headings**: To give that "classic publication" feel.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Informative. Hovering over a fish reveals quick stats (pH, temp, size).
  **Animation**: Crisp and precise. Flip cards or slide-ups for details.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: 'Playfair Display' (Serif) - Elegant and authoritative.
  *   **Body**: 'Roboto' (Sans-serif) - Clean and functional.
